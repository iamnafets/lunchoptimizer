Initial Release
* Restaurant history
  -Need to have a screen for a user to edit their own restaurant
    history (potentially using the calendar template)
  -Need to find a way to record history based on where a group
    went and if a user opted in
* Group Restaurants
  -Groups must be able to select which restaurants are in the group
* Individual preferences
  -Users must be able to rank all of the restaurants for groups they
    are part of
  -Users should be able to rank all of the restaurants for the group
   after they've joined (potentially show this on the main group page)
* Hatred
  -Users can "hate" a restaurant instead of ranking it
* Basic functionality
  -People opt in to lunch with a group
  -At a specific time, the place is decided
  -At a further time, opting in is closed and the email is sent out

Second Wave
* Categories
  -Histogrammed penalties will be implemented based on weighted recency across
    all attendees
* Location awareness
  -Users with location aware opt-in can change the centroid and hence 
    the choice of restaurant
* Crave
  -Users can temporarily bump ONE restaurant for that day

Future
* Mobile opt-in
